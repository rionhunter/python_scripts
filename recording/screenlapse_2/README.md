# Project Outline

## Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a package compiler for Python that automates the process of assessing and generating a list of required non-standard packages needed for a Python project to function properly. The compiler will scan all the scripts within a given directory, analyze the import statements, and create a text file containing a comprehensive list of package requirements that are not included in the standard default Python installation.

## Features
1. Directory Scanner
   - Scan a specified directory to identify all the Python scripts.

2. Import Extractor
   - Extract import statements from each Python script.

3. Package Analyzer
   - Analyze the extracted import statements to identify non-standard package requirements.
    
4. Requirements Generator
   - Generate a text file containing a list of all the non-standard package requirements.

5. User-Friendly Interface
   - Provide a simple and intuitive command-line interface for users to interact with the package compiler.

## Steps to Implement
1. Set up the project structure and initialize a virtual environment.
2. Implement the directory scanner to identify Python scripts within the specified directory.
3. Develop the import extractor to extract import statements from the identified Python scripts.
4. Create a package analyzer to analyze the extracted import statements and identify non-standard package requirements.
5. Implement the requirements generator to generate a text file with the list of package requirements.
6. Design and implement a user-friendly command-line interface for the package compiler.
7. Test the package compiler with various Python projects to ensure accurate identification of package requirements.
8. Refactor and optimize the codebase for efficiency and readability.
9. Document the project's functionality, usage instructions, and any additional information.
10. Conduct thorough testing and debugging to ensure the reliability and stability of the package compiler.

## Optional Enhancements (If Time Permits)
- Implement a GUI for the package compiler to enhance usability.
- Integrate an online package repository API to automate the installation of required packages.
- Develop a feature to handle versioning requirements for packages.
- Implement the ability to exclude certain packages or directories from the analysis.
- Expand the package compiler to support other programming languages.
