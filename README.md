# python_scripts
useful catalogue of scripts for helping work on other things (mainly built around gamedev tasks)

# bad text scanner
- asks for a folder then a file type, then scans recursively and notes all that aren't UTF-8 compliant

# folder string filetype scanner
- asks for folder then file type, then string. recursively scans and returns a list of all files that contain the string

# image scale reducer
- Can be started by draggin an image onto it. Produces a file in the same location as the original with a suffix of its reduced scale amount (for which it will ask you)

# list orderer
- takes a string from your clipboard, assesses each line for a number at the start. If it does it ensures it's in correct order with all the rest of the numbers

# png inverter
- good for icons

# string counter
