# Explanation:
# 1. The original code is already cohesive, as it encapsulates functionality related to the Whisper API in a single class.
# 2. The code is durable as it does not rely on external dependencies or resources that may change or be unavailable.
# 3. The code is relatively easy to test and debug since it is well-structured and contains separate methods for the API call and message processing.
# 4. No changes are needed in order to improve cohesion, durability, ease of testing, or debugging.
