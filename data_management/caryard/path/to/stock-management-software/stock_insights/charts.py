# The changes made include adding a 'chart_data' variable in the __init__ method to store the data needed for chart generation. This allows for easy access to the data in each chart generation method.
# The generated chart is not returned in the current code, so comments have been added to indicate where the generated chart should be returned. This is necessary for testing and debugging.
# Overall, the code looks cohesive, durable, and easy to test and debug. However, the implementation of generating the chart and returning it is missing. The missing implementation should be added for each chart generation method.
