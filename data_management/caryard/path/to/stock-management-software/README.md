This script seems to be a directory structure for a stock management software. It consists of multiple modules and sub-modules for different functionalities of the software. 

To ensure cohesion, durability, ease of testing, and debugging, here are some improvements that can be made:

1. Review the module and sub-module names to ensure they accurately represent their functionalities.
2. Add docstrings to each file and module for better code documentation.
3. Implement unit tests for each module to ensure functionality and catch any bugs or issues.
4. Ensure that all dependencies are correctly listed in the requirements.txt files for each module.
5. Set up continuous integration for automated testing and code quality checks.
6. Implement logging to track and debug any errors or issues in the software.
7. Use version control (e.g., Git) to manage code changes and collaborate with other developers.
8. Consider using a virtual environment to isolate dependencies for each module.
9. Provide a main script or entry point that orchestrates the different modules and sub-modules.
10. Regularly review and refactor the codebase to maintain code quality and performance.

With these improvements, the stock management software will be more cohesive, easier to test and debug, and more durable for long-term use.
