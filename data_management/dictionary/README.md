# Dictionary Constructor GUI Project Outline

## Introduction
A Python GUI interface that allows users to build and manipulate dictionaries. Users can create new dictionary structures, add slots with various value types, including nested dictionaries. The application should provide features such as saving, loading, editing, duplication, and exporting the dictionaries to different formats. Additionally, external modules should be able to access user-created dictionaries by identifying their structure names.

## Features
1. Graphical User Interface (GUI)
   - The application should have an intuitive and user-friendly interface.
   - Users should be able to navigate through different windows or sections to perform specific tasks.

2. Create Dictionary
   - Users can create a new dictionary structure.
   - The initial dictionary will be empty.

3. Add Slots
   - Users can add new slots to a dictionary.
   - Slots can have different value types:
     - String
     - Integer
     - Floating-point number
     - Boolean
     - Nested Dictionary (opens in a new window)
   - Users should be able to specify the slot name and its value type.

4. Edit Slots
   - Users can edit the values of existing slots.
   - For nested dictionaries, users can navigate to the nested structure and make changes.

5. Duplicate Dictionary Structures
   - Users can create copies of existing dictionary structures.
   - Copies should retain all the slot values and nested structures.

6. Save and Load Dictionaries
   - Users can save the dictionary structures to persistent storage (e.g., files) for later use.
   - Saved dictionaries should retain their entire structure, including all slot values and nested dictionaries.
   - Users can load previously saved dictionaries back into the application for editing or exporting.

7. Export Dictionaries
   - Users can export the dictionary structures to various formats:
     - JSON
     - CSV
     - Python compatible format (.py)
     - Plain text (.txt)
     - Clipboard (direct export to Python-compatible clipboard representation)

8. External Module Access
   - External modules can access and retrieve user-created dictionaries.
   - The access should be based on identifying dictionary structure names.
   - External modules should be able to read and utilize the dictionaries within their own code.

## Conclusion
The Dictionary Constructor GUI project aims to provide a user-friendly interface for creating, editing, saving, loading, duplicating, and exporting dictionaries. The application also allows external modules to access the user-created dictionaries through structure identification.
