Dictionary Constructor GUI - python gui interface that allows the user to build up a dictionary, adding new slots of differing value types, including further nested dictionaries - which open in a new window. User can save, load, edit and duplicate the resulting dictionary structures, and export to various formats including json, csv, python, .txt, or python compatible straight to the clipboard. External modules will need to be able to summon the user created dictionaries by identifying the structure's name
